        <p>How to use Skript:</p>

        <p>There's a lot to know about Skript, so let's start with the basics.</p>
        <p>After every ":" you have to indent the next line 1 time.</p>
        <p>If you want to add more to a section, go from that same line and keep writing. Here's an example:</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Example</summary>
            <pre>on right click:
                if player is sneaking:
                    spawn chicken at player's location
                if player isn't sneaking:
                    spawn cow at player's location</pre>
            <p>So now if the player is sneaking, it spawns a chicken, but if they aren't, it spawns a cow.</p>
        </details>

        <p>Down below are more Skript Tutorials</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Commands</summary>
            <p>There's a couple of things to know about commands</p>
            <p>1) The "trigger:" always comes last</p>
            <p>2) Permission is who can use the command, such as an operator</p>
            <pre>permission: op</pre>
            <p>3) Cooldown is how long it takes before being able to use the command again</p>
            <pre>cooldown: 5 seconds</pre>
            <p>The Cooldown message is the message the player gets for trying to use the command before the cooldown is over</p>
            <pre>cooldown message: must wait 5 seconds before using this command again</pre>
            <p>Trigger is what makes the command work; without it, the command doesn't work.</p>
            <pre>trigger:</pre>
            <p>Let's say you want to make a duplication command that duplicates the item in the player's hand:</p>
            <pre>command /dupe:
    permission: op
    cooldown: 5 seconds
    cooldown message: must wait 5 seconds before using this command again
    trigger:
        #code
            </pre>
            <p>Arguments are the second part of the command.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <pre>/tp gamerkid gamerguy</pre>
            <p>That command teleports gamerkid to gamerguy, gamerkid and gamerguy are both arguments.</p>
            <p>A better example is in the code:</p>
            <pre>command /dupe < player >:
    trigger:
        #code</pre>
            <p>Make sure to delete the space between the two "<>"</p>
            <p>Basically, what < player > does is find a player to target the command to, just like the teleport command.</p>
            <p>If I want to send a message to a player after giving them a diamond, I would do:</p>
            <pre>command /diamond < player > < text >:
    trigger:
        give arg-1 1 of diamond
        send arg-2 to arg-1</pre>
            <p>arg-1 is the player and arg-2 is the text. If the text comes first, then text will be arg-1 and the player would be arg-2.</p>
            <p>And Lastly Aliases, aliases are a short version of a command so instead of typing /teleport you could type /tp</p>
            <pre>command /aliases:
    aliases: /ali, /a</pre>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Abilities</summary>
            <p>Abilities can be really easy or really difficult, but they're in almost all plugins.</p>
            <p>There are different sections for different things, so if I wanted to right-click a diamond sword to spawn a chicken, I would do:</p>
            <pre>on right click:
    if player's held item is diamond sword:
        spawn chicken at player's location</pre>
            <p>You can also set a variable by doing:</p>
            <pre>set {name} to diamond sword</pre>
            <p>Most of the time, the variables are made in the "on load:" section so that they don't have to manually set the variable with a command or ability.</p>
            <pre>on load:
    set {sword} to diamond sword named "Ability Sword" with lore "Right Click for Cool Abilities"
    set custom model data of {sword} to 1
    set string tag "ID" of {sword} to "sword"</pre>
            <p>Setting a custom model data will make the item its own item and not get confused with another diamond sword/item.</p>
            <p>You can also make text colorful by using "&" and a color code. An easy way to find the color code is by using this site: https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php and looking at the chat codes.</p>
            <pre>send "&cRed Text" to player</pre>
            <p>Another fundamental part of coding abilities, you don’t want the player to be able to use the ability every second.</p>
            <p>There are a couple of different cooldowns you can do, but this will discuss two easy ones:</p>
            <pre>if difference between now and {cooldown::%uuid of player%} is less than 3 minutes:
    send action bar "&cWait %difference between 2 minutes and (difference between now and {cooldown::%uuid of player%})% before you can use this ability again"
    else:
        set {cooldown::%uuid of player%} to now</pre>
            <p>Another thing to discuss is if-else statements. An if-else statement is pretty much what it sounds like, and if you know basic coding, you know what this is.</p>
            <p>An example is: if the player is holding an iron sword, do this, else, do that.</p>
            <pre>on right click:
    if player's held item is {sword}:
        #code
    else:
        #code</pre>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Variables & Lists</summary>
            <p>Variables are little storage containers for items along with lists. An example would be if I wanted to set a sword to a variable and give the variable to a player:</p>
            <pre>on load:
    set {variable} to diamond sword named "&cTest Variable" with lore "This is a Variable!"

command /variable < player >:
    trigger:
        if arg-1 is set:
            give arg-1 1 of {variable}
        else:
            give player 1 of {variable}</pre>
            <p>To make the code neater, skip 1 line after changing a topic:</p>
            <pre>on load:

command /neat:

on right click:</pre>
            <p>It helps understand the code easier, and there’s less clutter.</p>
            <p>A list is multiple items in a variable, so if I wanted to make a kit for a player:</p>
            <pre>on load:
    set {kit::*} to diamond sword, diamond helmet, diamond chestplate, diamond leggings, and diamond boots

command /kit:
    trigger:
        give player {kits::*}</pre>
            <p>you can also set a variable to a helmet and set the player's helmet to that variable</p>
            <pre>on load:
    set {helmet} to diamond helmet named "helmet"

command /helmet:
    trigger:
        set player's helmet to {helmet}</pre>
        </details>
        
        <details>
            <summary>Effects</summary>
            <p>Effects are kind of weird, to apply an effect you'd have to do</p>
            <pre>apply strength to player for 30 seconds</pre>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Syntax</summary>
            <p>Syntax is probably the hardest part about code, its learning how to read examples of code and the errors when you reload the code.</p>
            <pre>[on] first (join|login)</pre>
            <pre>on first join:</pre>
            <p>The values "event-string" are event-player, and event-world</p>
            <p>Errors are really easy to read they pretty much tell you what you need to fix and where the error is</p>
<pre>[14:06:18 INFO] Line 28: (filename.sk)

        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>"Combining" Code / Writing Code in the same line</summary>
            <p>When writing code it could get really messy so instead of having multiple on right click events you could just do all the effects in the same event</p>
            <pre>on right click:
    if player's held item is {neat}:
        if player isn't sneaking:
            apply strength to player for 10 seconds
            send action bar "&cYou have &4Strength &cfor 10 seconds!"
        else:
            apply water breathing to player for 10 seconds
            send action bar "&cYou can now &3Breathe Underwater &cfor 10 seconds!"
    else:
        send action bar "&cMust unsneak to use this ability"</pre>
        <p>Wherever your if statement starts if you want it to do something else if the player ISNT doing that if statement place an "else" under it and continue</p>
